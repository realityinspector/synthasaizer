Audio Fingerprinting Text Encoder/Decoder

This project provides a Python-based tool for encoding text into unique audio fingerprints and decoding it back to text. It leverages specific audio properties such as frequency, amplitude, and duration to represent text tokens.
Overview

The tool supports encoding text by converting each token into an audio waveform characterized by unique frequency, amplitude, and duration attributes. The decoded audio can then be converted back into the original text. This system can be used for various applications, including secure data transmission and watermarking audio files.
Configuration

The config.json file allows users to specify several parameters for the encoding process:

    Models: Defines different model sizes (small, medium, large) and their corresponding word count limits.
    Output Directory: The directory where output files are stored.
    Wave Types: Types of waveforms used for encoding (e.g., sine, square, sawtooth, triangle).
    Volumes: Volume levels for the audio output.
    Harmonics: Harmonic frequencies to be used in the encoding process.
    Use GPU: Boolean value indicating whether to use GPU acceleration.

Fingerprints

The fingerprints.json file contains pre-defined audio properties for each token, such as frequency, amplitude, and duration.
Components

    script.py: The main script to run the encoding/decoding process.
    encoder.py: Handles the encoding of text into audio fingerprints.
    decoder.py: Decodes audio fingerprints back into text.
    generate_fingerprints.py: Generates a fingerprints.json file based on input text.
    file_handler.py: Manages file input/output operations.
    token2tone.py: Converts tokens to tones based on predefined or dynamically generated fingerprints.
    config.json: Configuration file with parameters for encoding and decoding.
    fingerprints.json: Predefined audio fingerprints for the text tokens.

Getting Started

    Setup Environment: Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed. Create a virtual environment and install the required packages.

    Configuration: Adjust the parameters in config.json as needed for your project.

    Run Encoding/Decoding: Use script.py to encode or decode text. For encoding, provide a text file as input. For decoding, provide an audio file generated by the encoder.

Usage Example

bash

python script.py --action encode --input mytext.txt
python script.py --action decode --input myaudio.wav
